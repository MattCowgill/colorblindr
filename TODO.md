TODO
=====
- Make convenience for each severity
- Rewrite the simulate_coloblind function so it works with transparency
- Rewrite with matrices
- Implement better model of color-deficient vision (CDV) than available in
  the dichromat package, using the theory explained here:
  http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~oliveira/pubs_files/CVD_Simulation/CVD_Simulation.html
  (This model is also implemented in python here, for reference:
  https://github.com/njsmith/colorspacious/blob/master/colorspacious/cvd.py
  )
- Write a better vignette
